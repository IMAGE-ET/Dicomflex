1.0
-> 1.1
- optimized thresholding for img2bwThresholding.m used for RSouterbound -> slighliy different SAT Volume...
- removed some "UseSlice" buggs
- imporved T1Mapper Gui

-> 1.2
- FatSegment: implemented RS_BodyBounds.m as autosegmentation function for all boundaries
- introduced saving of time stamps of Dicomflex framework tasks (load data, slice select,....)
- FatSegment: reimplanted hemiFat similar to femurbox
- FatSegment: XLS files will save the summary Fat values from Landmarks 'FK' to 'ZF'
- FatSegment: contourTracking on/off implemented (when drawing with the mouse, it searches in the proxim area for the strongest contour)
- FatSegment: 'x' key will switch between contourTracking on/off

-> 1.21
- FatSegment: HemiLine was not stored in the Session file - Solved
- FatSegment: HimeLine and FemurRect mode improved
- FatSegment: "AutoSegmentAll" segements now Slices from FK to ZF only

-> 1.22
- FatSegment: "AutoSegmentAll" segements now Slices from BB to ZF only
- FatSegment: XLS files will save the summary Fat values from Landmarks 'BB' to 'ZF'
- FatSegment: FemurBox showed wrong size due to rounding of matlab function createmask(hRect). The created mask was in general to small - solved

-> 1.23
- cCompute.mGetImgPathes: when mor folder search results appear, they will be only folders
- FatSegment: changed mSetHemiLine y22 definition to imgSize(1) from imgSize(2)
- ConfigApplication_template FatSegement: "xlsSaveRange" added and implemented in cComputeFatSegment
- ConfigApplication_template FatSegement: "doSliceSpacingInterpolation" added and implemented in cComputeFatSegment
- zoom view bug behoben (probleme bei nicht quadratischen Bilddaten)
