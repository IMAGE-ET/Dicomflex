The Dicomflex is a Matlab (R2016b) based software template focusing on the creation of tools for systematic, similar image processing of image stacks (e.g.: CT, MRI, â€¦).

To get started include the main folder, subfun, and FitTool to your Matlab directories and type cControl to start. A list dialog will appear to choose from the available modes. Available modes are determined by the existence of cfg_application_*.json files in the main directory.
